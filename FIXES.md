# Fixes Applied to the Fresherman Project

This document outlines the fixes that were applied to resolve errors in the project.

## 1. Fixed DOM Nesting Error

**Problem**: The error `<div> cannot appear as a descendant of <p>` was occurring because the Badge component was using a `<div>` element, which is a block element, inside a `<p>` element, which is not valid HTML.

**Solution**: The Badge component was modified to use a `<span>` element instead of a `<div>` element. This change ensures proper HTML nesting since `<span>` is an inline element that can be used inside a paragraph.

File changed: `src/components/ui/badge.tsx`

## 2. Fixed Database Schema for Vehicles

**Problem**: The error `Could not find the 'insurancePolicy' column of 'vehicles' in the schema cache` occurred because the database schema did not match the component's expected structure.

**Solution**: A new migration file was created that defines the vehicles and maintenance_records tables with all the required columns, including the missing `insurancePolicy` column.

New file created: `supabase/migrations/20240403_create_vehicle_table.sql`

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **UI Component Fixes**: These changes are already applied to the codebase.

2. **Database Schema Fixes**: To apply the database schema changes, it is recommended to use the Supabase CLI:
    * Ensure you have the Supabase CLI installed and configured for your project.
    * Run the command `supabase db reset` to apply all migrations in the `supabase/migrations` folder. **Warning:** This command will reset your local database. For production, use `supabase migration up`.
    * Alternatively, you can manually copy the SQL commands from the migration files (`20240403_create_medical_employment_tables.sql` and `20240403_create_vehicle_table.sql`) and run them in the Supabase SQL Editor in your project dashboard.

    The `apply-migrations.js` script is available but using the official Supabase CLI is preferred for managing migrations.

## Additional Notes

- The database schema changes ensure that the `vehicles` and `maintenance_records` tables match the structure expected by the components.
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies are implemented to ensure that users can only access their own data.
- Triggers are created to automatically update the `updated_at` column when records are modified.

After applying these fixes, the Vehicle component should work correctly without errors.
